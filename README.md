# CAPEv2 Sandbox Installation from Begin
This repository provides an automated script for installing and configuring CAPE Sandbox. I used this sandbox as part of my thesis to extract network traffic. This repository also includes a documentation of errors encountered during the installation process, serving as a guide for others who might face similar issues.

## What is CAPEv2 :
CAPE Sandbox is an Open Source software for automating analysis of suspicious files. To do so it makes use of custom components that monitor the behavior of the malicious processes while running in an isolated environment.

## Prepare Requirement
for installing CAPEv2 i used nested virtualization format, as firstly i used Ubuntu 22.04.4 as my base operating sysytem faced error for it, so decided to use nested format.
